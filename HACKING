The methodology to hack the site is VERY simple, only need local changes.

The KEY point is that Valuate.com, for some reason, stores daily domain search count LOCALLY, AKA, in cookies of the site! (Seriously, poor site maintainers should be fired...)

Check the "cookies" of the size, and you will find something looks like "val%2D[A]%2D[B]%2D[C]", where A, B and C are all numbers (actually representing the date of the check). I suspected they have done this since I discovered that switching browser could reset the daily check count, even when the same user has logged in.

The script simple starts with a headless browser with no cookies, and then by logging in and running single site search, fetching the generated cookie, set it to a HUGE (in abs terms) negative number (e.g. -100000, which, as I am amazed, the server ACCEPTED this number... No negative check?). Also, the single-time bulk search limit could be removed simply by injecting script and overwrite a single check function (as JS supports redefinition...)

I have NO intention to offend the site maintainers, and I know that they indeed charge very few comparing to other domain appraisal site. Therefore, if contacted or confronted, I would immediately delete the repository with NO hesitation (this project happened to be my first practice of PhantomJS). HOWEVER, considering the poor design that could be manipulated by a newbie coder... Valuate.com, seriously...
